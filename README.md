# 🏋🏼‍♂️ Lift 5X5 
- My first full stack project built to practice using React, REST API development with Spring Boot and GCP deployment. 
- The app uses the fetch method to POST the lifts to an Springboot API (see repo lift5x5-api). This is visible in the lift form "Add lifts" 
- It then uses a GET request on thed logged lifts to show all the lifts added to the databases. Here individual lifts can also be deleted, with the X icons on each card. 
##  Formating ✍️
- Formatted with Prettier

## Testing 🧪
- Filter and string helpers united tested using Jest.

## Styling & Conventions 
- The app uses SCSS, the CSS preprocessor. 
- Uses BEM naming conventions.
